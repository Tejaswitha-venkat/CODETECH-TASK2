# OVER VIEW OF THE PROJECT #
**PROJECT** **:PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION**

**OBJECTIVE**
The objective of the project is to perform predictive modeling with linear regression on a data set with continuous target variables.Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on
the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

**Key activities**
**split the data into training and testing sets
evaluate metrics like mean squared error or R-squared

**Technologies used**
python
pandas
