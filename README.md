# OVER VIEW OF THE PROJECT #
**PROJECT** **:PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION**

**OBJECTIVE**
The objective of the project is to perform predictive modeling with linear regression on a data set with continuous target variables.Split the data into training and testing sets, train the model on
the training data, evaluate its performance using metrics like mean squared error or R-squared, and make predictions on the test set. Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.

**Key activities**
**Split the data into training and testing sets

Evaluate metrics like mean squared error or R-squared

Visualize the regression line **

**Technologies used**
Python:The primary programming language in data analysis

pandas: used for data manipulation and analysis

seaborn:Used for making statistical graphs that are informative and attractive
